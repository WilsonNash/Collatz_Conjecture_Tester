# Collatz_Conjecture_Tester
JavaScript program that allows users to input numbers and test Collatz conjecture

The Collatz Conjecture has been called one of the most difficult problems in mathematics. While not fully understood, the basic idea of the conjecture is actually very simple.

Basically, the conjecture is that if you take any positive, whole number, and divide it by 2 if it's even, or multiply it by 3 and add 1 if it's odd, and then you do the same thing over and over again with the resulting number, you will always eventually get to 1. 

With a computer, it is of course very easy to test this, so I made a JavaScript program that allows users to input a number to see how many steps it takes to get back to 1.
